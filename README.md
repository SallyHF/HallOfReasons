Project for CFG Web Development Course

This is a website created for my final project for CodeFirstGirls web development course.

The website is a lighthearted and wacky haven for all sorts of reasons. The idea originated from my initial rocky start on my
tech journey. Constant doubts and morbid excuses were made to discourage myself from attending each lesson but I'm glad I perservered.

The coding is not perfect or as clean as I would like it to be but it was put together with many hours of self-learning and 
building ideas from the fundmental knowledge obtained from the course.

There is still many areas of improvement to be made and I hope to achieve the ultimate goals I have set for the website eventually and with
a more uniform layout in terms of padding, margin, etc.
